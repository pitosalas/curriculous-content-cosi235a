* This course web site is built with a software I developed, on top of a framework called [Nanoc](http://nanoc.ws)
* The site is hosted as a free public static site on [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
* The structure and terminology of parts of this course are inspired by the book:

* Many of the excercises and topics were used previously or based on similar courses that I developed with [Tim Hickey](http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~tim/) at [Brandeis University](www.brandeis.edu) as well as taught at [Olin College of Engineering](http://olin.edu).
* With a few exceptions, all of the actual text of this web site were written by me.
